Census - Town NPC Checklist modifies the housing panel to show missing townspeople. 

A "✓" signifies that the conditions for spawning that npc have been fulfilled. An "X" means that conditions have not been fulfilled. Hover over it to see the spawn conditions.

Mods can add the conditions for their town easily. In PostSetupContent, call census.Call("TownNPCCondition", mod.NPCType("ExamplePerson"), "Create a house from ExampleBlock.");

Currently doesn't work in multi-player. Feedback greatly appreciated. Townspeople spawn about 2 minutes after day begins, so the data shown might not be up to date until that check happens.

For multi-player, the server console command "TownProgress" can be useful for now.
